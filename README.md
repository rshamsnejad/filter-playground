Filter Playground is a small application allowing to play around with various types of filters and see what is the result of the cascades and sums of those filters.

Written in Python with the help of [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/signal.html) + [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for the computation backend, and [Qt](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/) + [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index) for the GUI.
